# QuantumChaosEncryption

A groundbreaking encryption system using quantum-inspired principles, chaos theory, and elliptic curve cryptography (ECC). 
This project provides a robust framework for securing intellectual property, aligning with ISO 20022 standards for real-world applicability.

## Features

- **Quantum-Inspired Constants**: Uses Planck's constant, π, and the golden ratio (Φ) for encryption.
- **Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)**: Ensures security and computational efficiency.
- **Chaotic Key Generation**: Introduces non-deterministic randomness through chaotic maps.
- **ISO 20022 Compliance**: Outputs encrypted data in a globally standardized format.

## Files

- `encryption_engine.py`: Core encryption logic.
- `encrypted_ip.txt`: Example of an encrypted intellectual property file.

## Usage

1. Run the script `encryption_engine.py`.
2. Input the data to be encrypted and specify the author name.
3. The encrypted data is saved as `encrypted_ip.txt`.
